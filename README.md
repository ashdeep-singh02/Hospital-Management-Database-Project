# Hospital-Management-Database-Project

Using this information, doctors can not only access their employment information, but also view their patients’ details- like their previous health conditions, surgeries, medications they are taking, future appointments, etc. The system can also serve as an appointment guide to schedule appointments for patients and doctors.
